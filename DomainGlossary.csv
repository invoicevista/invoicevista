 Term                                        ; Country / EU            ; Definition (simple language)
 XRechnung                                   ; Germany                     ; An XML-based electronic invoice format defined for Germany's public sector. XRechnung is Germany's primary CIUS (national implementation of the EU standard EN 16931) and has been mandatory for federal B2G invoices since 2018. It ensures invoices meet the European core data model and are machine-readable.
 ZUGFeRD                                     ; Germany                     ; A hybrid e-invoice format used in Germany that combines a human-readable PDF/A-3 invoice with an embedded XML file. The XML data (aligned to EN 16931) is machine-readable, while the PDF is for human viewing. ZUGFeRD 2.x uses the CII XML format embedded in PDF, allowing both people and software to read the same invoice.
 Facturae                                    ; Spain                       ; Spain’s national e-invoicing format (sometimes styled FacturaE). It’s an XML-based standard for electronic invoices, usually accompanied by an XAdES digital signature for authenticity. Facturae is mandated for invoices issued to Spanish public administrations (B2G) under Law 25/2013, ensuring a structured format that public systems can process.
 UBL (Universal Business Language)           ; International/EU            ; A globally used standard XML format for business documents (like invoices). UBL provides a predefined, structured format containing all the needed invoice information in a fixed way. By using UBL, different companies or countries can exchange e‑invoices in a common “language,” allowing interoperability without manual data entry.
 CII (Cross Industry Invoice)                ; International/EU            ; An XML-based electronic invoice format developed by UN/CEFACT (a UN standards body). CII is an alternative to UBL as a syntax for e-invoices. It also complies with the EU’s EN 16931 standard and provides a structured data model for invoices. (In practice, Germany’s XRechnung supports both UBL and CII, while ZUGFeRD embeds a CII file in a PDF.)
 PEPPOL                                      ; EU/International            ; Stands for Pan-European Public Procurement Online. It is a network and set of specifications that enable businesses and governments across different countries to exchange electronic procurement documents (e.g. orders, e-invoices) in a standardized, secure way. Through PEPPOL, organizations send/receive machine-readable invoices without needing custom integrations. (PEPPOL includes standards like the BIS 3.0 invoice format and a network of certified Access Points.)
 EN 16931                                    ; EU (European Standard)      ; The European Standard for e‑Invoicing (published by CEN). It defines the core semantic data model for an electronic invoice – essentially, which information must be present (buyer, seller, tax, totals, etc.) and how it’s structured for compatibility. EN 16931 ensures that e-invoices are machine-readable and interoperable across EU countries, so an invoice compliant with this standard can be understood by systems in any member state.
 CIUS (Core Invoice Usage Specification)     ; EU (concept)                ; A specific implementation guideline or adaptation of the EN 16931 standard for a particular use, country, or sector. A CIUS refines the core data model by adding rules or restrictions needed for local requirements. For example, XRechnung is the German CIUS (it applies Germany’s business rules to the European standard), ensuring invoices comply with both EN 16931 and German regulations.
 EU ViDA (VAT in the Digital Age)            ; EU (initiative)             ; A package of EU proposals aimed at modernizing VAT administration through digital technology. Agreed in late 2024, the ViDA reforms include making electronic invoicing the default method for invoicing in the EU by 1 July 2030, and introducing new digital reporting requirements for businesses. The goal is to improve tax efficiency, fight fraud (reduce the VAT gap), and harmonize e‑invoicing and VAT reporting across member states.
 DRR (Digital Reporting Requirements)        ; EU (under ViDA)             ; New obligations under the ViDA initiative requiring businesses to submit transaction data electronically to tax authorities on a frequent (near real-time or periodic) basis. In essence, DRRs mean companies must report invoice data digitally either continuously or at regular intervals. This move to digital, detailed reporting (often via e-invoices) helps tax authorities monitor VAT in real time and is planned to be implemented EU-wide by 2028 as part of the VAT in the Digital Age changes.
 CTC (Continuous Transaction Controls)       ; General (Tax Control Model) ; A model of tax compliance where each invoice or transaction is reported to, or approved by, the tax authority at the time of transaction (or very shortly after). Instead of periodic summary reports, tax data is transmitted continuously or in real-time. Italy’s e-invoicing system is an example of a CTC approach: since 2019, all B2B and B2C invoices go through the government SDI system as they are issued. CTC systems help improve VAT collection and reduce fraud by giving authorities immediate visibility of invoices.
 SDI (Sistema di Interscambio)               ; Italy                       ; Italy’s central e-invoice exchange platform (“Exchange System”). All electronic invoices in Italy are sent to the SDI, which acts as an intermediary: it validates the invoice format and data, then forwards the invoice to the correct recipient (e.g. the buyer or public administration). The SDI is managed by the tax authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) and ensures that invoices are in the proper FatturaPA format. Using SDI is mandatory for B2G invoices since 2014 and for all domestic B2B/B2C invoices since 2019.
 FatturaPA                                   ; Italy                       ; The Italian standard for electronic invoices (the name stands for Fatturazione Elettronica verso la Pubblica Amministrazione, meaning “e-invoicing to Public Administration”). It is an XML format aligned with EN 16931, originally introduced for government suppliers in 2014. Since 2019 Italy extended FatturaPA usage to all B2B and B2C invoices as well, making e-invoicing via FatturaPA (through SDI) compulsory for virtually all transactions. Each FatturaPA invoice is digitally signed and meets Italy’s legal and fiscal requirements.
 SII (Suministro Inmediato de Información)   ; Spain                       ; “Immediate Supply of Information” – Spain’s near-real-time VAT reporting system. Under SII, large companies and certain taxpayers must electronically send details of each issued and received invoice to the Tax Agency (AEAT) within a few days. This means the VAT ledgers are maintained online in almost real time. Companies using SII are exempt from other periodic VAT reporting because they report continuously. (SII, implemented in 2017, was one of Spain’s early steps toward digital control of VAT.)
 VeriFactu                                   ; Spain                       ; Short for “Verifiable Invoice Issuance System”. VeriFactu refers to new Spanish requirements (under Law 11/2021 and Royal Decree 1007/2023) for using certified billing software or systems that can transmit invoice records in real time to the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT). The system ensures each invoice’s integrity and immutability (using features like QR codes and digital signatures) and helps prevent sales suppression. From 2026, businesses in Spain will be required to either use compliant invoicing systems (SIF) or the VeriFactu mechanism to report all invoices as they are issued, for improved tax control.
 Crea y Crece                                ; Spain                       ; Literally “Create and Grow,” this is the nickname for Spain’s Law 18/2022 (September 2022) which establishes the mandatory use of e‑invoicing for B2B transactions in Spain. The law aims to help businesses (especially SMEs) digitalize and to increase transparency, reduce late payments, and improve efficiency. Implementation is phased: larger companies will need to comply one year after technical regulations are approved by the EU, and smaller companies within two years, subject to EU approval (due to the need for an EU VAT directive waiver for mandatory e-invoicing).
 FACe                                        ; Spain                       ; The Spanish government’s central e-invoice portal for public administrations. FACe (Facturae portal) is the single entry point where suppliers can submit electronic invoices to any Spanish public body. An invoice sent through FACe is routed to the correct authority (using directory codes), and suppliers can track its status. Use of FACe is mandatory for central government agencies and available for regional/local entities, ensuring a unified B2G invoicing process in Spain.
 Leitweg-ID                                  ; Germany                     ;" A ""routing code"" used in Germany's public-sector e-invoicing. The Leitweg-ID is a structured identifier that appears on e-invoices to public authorities, indicating the exact destination (specific agency or department). In Germany's decentralized B2G model with multiple invoice platforms, this ID ensures the invoice is routed to the correct public entity. It enables interoperability so that an invoice submitted via one platform can reach the appropriate government recipient seamlessly."
 XAdES                                       ; EU/International            ; XML Advanced Electronic Signatures - a set of extensions to XML-DSIG (XML Digital Signature) that makes XML signatures suitable for legal and regulatory requirements in Europe. XAdES provides long-term validity through timestamps and certificate validation data. It's commonly used with e-invoicing formats like Facturae to ensure authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of electronic invoices.
 PDF/A-3                                     ; International               ; An ISO-standardized version of PDF specifically designed for long-term archiving of electronic documents. PDF/A-3 (ISO 19005-3) allows embedding of files in any format, making it ideal for hybrid invoices like ZUGFeRD where machine-readable XML data is embedded within a human-readable PDF. This ensures both visual presentation and data extraction capabilities are preserved for archival purposes.
 B2G/B2B/B2C                                 ; General                     ; Business transaction types: B2G (Business-to-Government) refers to companies selling to public administrations, B2B (Business-to-Business) refers to transactions between companies, B2C (Business-to-Consumer) refers to companies selling to individual consumers. Different e-invoicing rules often apply to each type - for example, B2G e-invoicing is mandatory in most EU countries, while B2B/B2C requirements vary by country.
 VAT Gap                                     ; EU                          ; The difference between expected VAT revenues and actual VAT collected by tax authorities. The VAT gap includes tax evasion, fraud, avoidance, insolvencies, and administrative errors. E-invoicing and real-time reporting systems like CTC are designed to reduce the VAT gap by improving compliance and reducing opportunities for fraud. The EU estimates the VAT gap at over €60 billion annually.
 Access Point                                ; PEPPOL/EU                   ; A certified service provider in the PEPPOL network that enables organizations to send and receive electronic documents. Access Points handle the technical complexity of document validation, routing, and delivery across the PEPPOL network. Organizations connect to one Access Point to exchange documents with any other participant in the network, regardless of which Access Point they use.
 SMP (Service Metadata Publisher)            ; PEPPOL                      ; A component of the PEPPOL infrastructure that stores and provides information about which documents a PEPPOL participant can receive and through which Access Point. The SMP acts like a directory service, allowing senders to look up how to reach a specific recipient. It contains capability information such as supported document types and the recipient's Access Point address.
 Factur-X                                    ; France/Germany              ; The French-German standard for hybrid PDF/XML invoices, technically equivalent to ZUGFeRD 2.x. Factur-X combines a PDF for human reading with embedded structured XML data compliant with EN 16931. This joint standard promotes cross-border interoperability between France and Germany while maintaining the benefits of both human and machine readability.
 SAF-T (Standard Audit File for Tax)         ; EU/OECD                     ; An international standard for electronic exchange of accounting data from organizations to tax authorities. SAF-T provides a standardized XML format for exporting accounting records, including invoices, for tax audit purposes. Several EU countries (Portugal, Poland, Lithuania, Luxembourg) have implemented SAF-T requirements for periodic or on-demand reporting to tax authorities.
 Directive 2014/55/EU                        ; EU                          ; The EU directive on electronic invoicing in public procurement, requiring all public authorities to be able to receive and process electronic invoices conforming to EN 16931 standard. Implemented between 2018-2020, this directive established the legal framework for B2G e-invoicing across the EU, driving adoption of structured formats and PEPPOL network.
