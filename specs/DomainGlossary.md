It’s an XML-based standard for electronic invoices, usually accompanied by an **XAdES** digital signature for authenticity. Facturae is mandated for invoices issued to Spanish public administrations (B2G) under Law 25/2013[\[5\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Spain#:~:text=Facturae%20,eSignature%20following%20the%20XAdES%20standard), ensuring a structured format that public systems can process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **UBL (Universal Business Language)**           | International/EU            | A globally used standard XML format for business documents (like invoices).

It defines the **core semantic data model** for an electronic invoice – essentially, which information must be present (buyer, seller, tax, totals, etc.) and how it’s structured for compatibility[\[9\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Spain#:~:text=European%20Standard%20for%20eInvoicing%20EN,16931). EN 16931 ensures that e-invoices are **machine-readable and interoperable** across EU countries, so an invoice compliant with this standard can be understood by systems in any member state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **CIUS** (Core Invoice Usage Specification)     | EU (concept)                | A specific implementation guideline or adaptation of the EN 16931 standard for a particular use, country, or sector.

| **CTC** (Continuous Transaction Controls)       | General (Tax Control Model) | A model of tax compliance where each invoice or transaction is reported to, or approved by, the tax authority at the time of transaction (or very shortly after). Instead of periodic summary reports, tax data is transmitted **continuously or in real-time**. Italy’s e-invoicing system is an example of a CTC approach: since 2019, all B2B and B2C invoices go through the government **SDI** system as they are issued[\[13\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Italy#:~:text=Business,border%20transactions%20and). CTC systems help improve VAT collection and reduce fraud by giving authorities immediate visibility of invoices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

All electronic invoices in Italy are sent to the SDI, which acts as an intermediary: it **validates the invoice format and data**, then forwards the invoice to the correct recipient (e.g. the buyer or public administration)[\[14\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Italy#:~:text=suppliers%20to%20public%20administrations%20are,the%20%2059%20Agenzia%20delle)[\[15\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Italy#:~:text=Invoices%20must%20follow%20a%20specific,it%20digitally%20for%2010%20years). The SDI is managed by the tax authority (Agenzia delle Entrate) and ensures that invoices are in the proper **FatturaPA** format. Using SDI is mandatory for B2G invoices since 2014 and for all domestic B2B/B2C invoices since 2019.                                                                                                 |
| **FatturaPA**                                   | Italy                       | The Italian standard for electronic invoices (the name stands for *Fatturazione Elettronica verso la Pubblica Amministrazione*, meaning “e-invoicing to Public Administration”). It is an XML format aligned with EN 16931[\[16\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Italy#:~:text=administrations%29%20from%2031%20March%202015,Since%201%20January%202019%2C%20all)[\[17\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Italy#:~:text=authorities%20are%20required%20to%20accept,and%20compliance%20rules%20for%20FatturaPA), originally introduced for government suppliers in 2014. Since 2019 Italy extended FatturaPA usage to **all B2B and B2C invoices** as well, making e-invoicing via FatturaPA (through SDI) compulsory for virtually all transactions. Each FatturaPA invoice is digitally signed and meets Italy’s legal and fiscal requirements.                                                             |
| **SII** (*Suministro Inmediato de Información*) | Spain                       | “Immediate Supply of Information” – Spain’s near-real-time VAT reporting system. Under SII, large companies and certain taxpayers must electronically send details of each issued and received invoice to the Tax Agency (AEAT) within a few days[\[18\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Spain#:~:text=,the%20public). This means the VAT ledgers are maintained online in almost real time. Companies using SII are **exempt from other periodic VAT reporting** because they report continuously. (SII, implemented in 2017, was one of Spain’s early steps toward digital control of VAT.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **VeriFactu**                                   | Spain                       | Short for “Verifiable Invoice Issuance System”. **VeriFactu** refers to new Spanish requirements (under Law 11/2021 and Royal Decree 1007/2023) for using certified billing software or systems that can **transmit invoice records in real time to the Spanish Tax Agency** (AEAT)[\[19\]](https://edicomgroup.com/blog/spain-computerized-invoicing-system#:~:text=An%20approved%20Computerized%20Billing%20System,AEAT)[\[20\]](https://www.bdo.global/en-gb/insights/tax/indirect-tax/spain-e-invoicing,-billing-systems-and-the-vida-package#:~:text=use%20certified%20billing%20software%20to,are%20issued%2C%20strengthening%20fiscal%20control). The system ensures each invoice’s integrity and immutability (using features like QR codes and digital signatures) and helps prevent sales suppression. From 2026, businesses in Spain will be required to either use compliant invoicing systems (SIF) or the VeriFactu mechanism to report all invoices as they are issued, for improved tax control. |
| **Crea y Crece**                                | Spain                       | Literally “Create and Grow,” this is the nickname for Spain’s Law 18/2022 (September 2022) which establishes the **mandatory use of e‑invoicing for B2B transactions** in Spain[\[21\]](https://www.bdo.global/en-gb/insights/tax/indirect-tax/spain-e-invoicing,-billing-systems-and-the-vida-package#:~:text=,Invoicing%20and%20Billing%20Software%20%28Veri%2Afactu). The law aims to help businesses (especially SMEs) digitalize and to increase transparency, reduce late payments, and improve efficiency. Implementation is phased: larger companies will need to comply one year after technical regulations are approved by the EU, and smaller companies within two years, subject to EU approval (due to the need for an EU VAT directive waiver for mandatory e-invoicing).                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **FACe**                                        | Spain                       | The Spanish government’s central **e-invoice portal** for public administrations. FACe (Facturae portal) is the single entry point where suppliers can submit electronic invoices to any Spanish public body[\[22\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Spain#:~:text=EU%20Public%20Procurement%20thresholds%20,Standard%20for%20eInvoicing%20EN%2016931). An invoice sent through FACe is routed to the correct authority (using directory codes), and suppliers can track its status. Use of FACe is mandatory for central government agencies and available for regional/local entities, ensuring a unified B2G invoicing process in Spain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Leitweg-ID**                                  | Germany                     | A “routing code” used in Germany’s public-sector e-invoicing. The Leitweg-ID is a structured identifier that appears on e-invoices to public authorities, indicating the exact destination (specific agency or department). In Germany’s decentralized B2G model with multiple invoice platforms, this ID ensures the invoice is **routed to the correct public entity[\[23\]](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/sites/display/DIGITAL/eInvoicing+in+Germany#:~:text=,has%20fully%20implemented%20the%20European)**. It enables interoperability so that an invoice submitted via one platform can reach the appropriate government recipient seamlessly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
