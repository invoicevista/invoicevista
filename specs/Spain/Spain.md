# Spain's E-invoicing Standards Landscape Through 2031

Spain stands at a critical juncture in its e-invoicing evolution, with mandatory B2G requirements already in place since 2015, while B2B mandates face repeated delays now targeting 2027-2028 implementation. The recently adopted EU ViDA directive adds another layer of complexity, requiring cross-border B2B e-invoicing by 2030.

The Spanish e-invoicing ecosystem comprises multiple overlapping systems: the established FACe platform for government transactions, the SII real-time VAT reporting system for large taxpayers, the upcoming VeriFactu certified software requirement launching in 2026, and the repeatedly delayed Crea y Crece B2B mandate. These domestic initiatives must now align with EU-wide harmonization efforts under ViDA, creating a complex regulatory landscape that businesses must navigate through 2031 and beyond.

## Currently Enacted Standards

### B2G E-invoicing Requirements

Spain's **Law 25/2013** has required electronic invoicing for all public sector transactions since January 15, 2015, making Spain an early adopter in Europe. The law mandates that all suppliers to public administrations use electronic invoices through the **FACe platform** (Facilita la Administración de la Comunicación Electrónica), which serves as the single entry point for government e-invoices.

The primary format remains **Facturae v3.2.X**, Spain's XML-based national standard, though the system also accepts invoices compliant with **EN 16931** (the European e-invoicing standard), as well as UBL and CII formats through automatic conversion. All invoices require **XAdES electronic signatures** based on qualified certificates. Small invoices under €5,000 may still be submitted in paper format, representing the only significant exemption.

### VAT Reporting Through SII

Since July 1, 2017, businesses with annual turnover exceeding **€6 million** must use the **SII (Suministro Inmediato de Información)** system for real-time VAT reporting. This system requires electronic submission of all invoice data within four working days of issuance or receipt, effectively creating a parallel e-invoicing infrastructure for tax compliance.

The SII covers all transaction types - B2B, B2G, and B2C - both domestic and cross-border. Companies must maintain four electronic books: outgoing invoices, incoming invoices, intra-community operations, and investment goods. While not technically an e-invoicing mandate, SII has driven significant digitalization among Spain's largest taxpayers.

### Regional Variations Currently Active

The **Basque Country** has implemented its own **TicketBAI** system, fully operational since 2024. This mandatory system requires all businesses and self-employed individuals in Álava, Gipuzkoa, and Bizkaia to use certified software generating XML files with electronic signatures, invoice chaining, and QR codes for real-time reporting to provincial tax authorities. Each Basque province maintains its own implementation timeline and web applications, though the core requirements remain consistent.

## Upcoming Standards Through 2031

### VeriFactu System (2026)

Spain's **VeriFactu** system, established by Royal Decree 1007/2023, will require certified invoicing software for all taxpayers not already using the SII system. Corporate taxpayers must comply by **January 1, 2026**, while self-employed individuals have until **July 1, 2026**. 

The system mandates QR codes on all invoices, specific legends indicating verification capability, and real-time transmission to the tax authority (AEAT). Ministerial Order HAC/1177/2024 published the technical specifications in October 2024, giving software developers a 9-month adaptation period. Businesses already using SII are exempt from VeriFactu requirements.

### Crea y Crece B2B Mandate (2027-2028)

Law 18/2022 ("Crea y Crece") establishes Spain's long-awaited mandatory B2B e-invoicing framework, though implementation has faced significant delays. Originally planned for 2024-2025, the system now targets **2027 for large companies** (annual turnover exceeding €8 million) and **2028 for all other businesses**.

The most significant technical change involves abandoning Spain's traditional Facturae format in favor of **UBL (Universal Business Language)** as the primary standard, aligning with EU requirements. The system will operate through a mixed model combining private e-invoicing platforms with a public solution managed by AEAT. All platforms must interconnect, and invoices will require advanced electronic signatures under the eIDAS Regulation.

### EU ViDA Requirements (2030)

The EU's VAT in the Digital Age (ViDA) directive, formally adopted as **Council Directive (EU) 2025/516** on March 11, 2025, introduces mandatory e-invoicing for cross-border B2B transactions starting **July 1, 2030**. Spanish businesses conducting intra-EU trade must issue structured e-invoices compliant with the **EN 16931** standard within 10 days of supply.

ViDA also introduces Digital Reporting Requirements (DRR), mandating that invoice data be reported to tax authorities within two working days of issuance. This effectively replaces the current EC Sales List with real-time fraud detection capabilities. Spain must ensure its domestic systems harmonize with EU standards by **January 1, 2035**.

### Implementation timeline for Spanish businesses

The staggered implementation creates distinct compliance milestones. **2026** brings VeriFactu for non-SII taxpayers, while **2027-2028** sees the Crea y Crece B2B mandate phased in by company size. By **2030**, cross-border transactions must comply with EU ViDA requirements, and **2035** marks the deadline for full harmonization between Spanish and EU systems.

Spain's approach notably front-loads domestic requirements ahead of EU mandates, potentially easing the transition to ViDA compliance. However, businesses face the complexity of navigating multiple systems - FACe for government transactions, SII or VeriFactu for tax reporting, regional requirements like TicketBAI, and the upcoming Crea y Crece B2B platform.

## Distinguishing B2G from B2B Requirements

B2G e-invoicing operates under a mature, stable framework active since 2015. The FACe platform provides centralized processing, with clear format requirements (primarily Facturae) and established compliance procedures. All public entities must accept e-invoices, creating universal coverage for government transactions.

B2B requirements remain fragmented until the Crea y Crece implementation. Currently, B2B e-invoicing stays voluntary except for tax reporting obligations under SII (for large companies) or the upcoming VeriFactu system. The future mandatory B2B system will differ significantly from B2G, using UBL format instead of Facturae and operating through interconnected private and public platforms rather than a single centralized system.

## Spanish Domestic vs. EU-Wide Regulations

Spanish regulations have historically preceded EU requirements, as seen with Law 25/2013 anticipating the EU's 2014 public procurement directive. This pattern continues with Crea y Crece targeting 2027-2028 implementation, ahead of ViDA's 2030 cross-border mandate.

However, Spain has adapted its approach to align with EU standards. The shift from Facturae to UBL for B2B transactions demonstrates this harmonization effort. Spanish requirements often exceed EU minimums - adding payment tracking, commercial debt monitoring, and QR code mandates not specified in EU directives. The SII system's real-time reporting similarly goes beyond current EU requirements, though ViDA's DRR will establish similar standards EU-wide by 2030.

Regional variations add another layer, with the Basque Country's TicketBAI system operating independently from national mandates while still needing to comply with future EU requirements. This creates a three-tier compliance structure: regional, national, and European.

## Key Compliance Considerations

Businesses operating in Spain must prepare for multiple overlapping systems with different timelines and requirements. Large companies already using SII face fewer changes, primarily needing to adapt to Crea y Crece B2B requirements by 2027. Smaller businesses confronting VeriFactu in 2026 must implement certified software before facing additional B2B mandates in 2028.

Companies engaged in cross-border EU trade should begin preparing for ViDA compliance well before the 2030 deadline, as the shift to real-time reporting and EN 16931 format requirements will require significant system adaptations. Those operating in the Basque Country or planning operations in Navarra must account for additional regional requirements beyond national mandates.

The technical shift from Facturae to UBL for B2B transactions represents a fundamental change in Spain's e-invoicing architecture, requiring businesses to plan for format migration and potential system replacements. The interconnection requirements between platforms suggest that choosing e-invoicing providers carefully will become crucial for seamless compliance across multiple mandates.
